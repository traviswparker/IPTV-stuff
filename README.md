iptv.py generates m3u playlists from xtream codes:\
./iptv.py URL USER PASS  (to check acct)\
./iptv.py URL USER PASS m3u_file (check acct and write m3u)\
./iptv.py config_file (to check accts)\
./optv.py config_file m3u_file (to check accts, write m3u, reload threadfin)\

tuner/tuner.py is like xteve/threadfin/dispatcharr but far more lightweight.\
tuner/tuner.py config_file

lineup filtering:\
GROUPS=pattern of groups to match, default is exact match, ^pattern for start match, pattern$ for end match, !pattern to exclude\
STRIP=patterns to strip from stream names. default is anywhere in name, ^pattern for start match, pattern$ for end match\
STREAMS=patterns to include and !patterns for streams to remove, ignores GROUPS. matches anywhere in name.\
REPLACE=replace any streams with the same name if a stream matching name+pattern exists.\
 example: REPLACE= UHD will turn 'ABC UHD' into 'ABC', removing any streams named 'ABC', but only if 'ABC UHD' exists.

server config (can set in config or environment)\
SERVER_IP, SERVER_PORT to set listening IP and port. Defaults to localhost:5004\
DIRECT=1 will bypass ffmpeg remuxing and redirect clients to the remote stream URL after following any redirects.\

list xtream codes as\
URL USER PASS\
If given a config with multiple xtream codes, will check and pick the account with the most open slots per stream request.
